# Machine Learning Visualizers

This repository contains a series of interactive Streamlit applications designed to visualize and explain different machine learning algorithms. Each application allows users to manipulate parameters and see the effects on the model in real-time.

## Algorithms Covered

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Understand the basics of Naive Bayes and see how it classifies data.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Explore how K-Means clustering works and how it partitions the data into clusters.
- **Linear Regression**: Visualize how Linear Regression models the relationship between variables.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Discover how Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and how it uses them for classification.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Learn about SVM and its capability to create non-linear decision boundaries using kernels.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: See how PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving variance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these applications, you'll need Python installed on your system. The applications also require several Python libraries, listed in `requirements.txt`.
