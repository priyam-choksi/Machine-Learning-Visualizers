# Machine Learning Visualizers

Welcome to the Machine Learning Visualizers repository! This collection of Streamlit applications is designed to demonstrate and explain various machine learning algorithms through interactive visualizations. Each app allows users to adjust parameters and see the effects on the model's performance and decision-making process in real time.

## Algorithms Covered

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: [Explore](https://machine-learning-visualizers-bayes.streamlit.app/) the basics of Naive Bayes and its application in classification tasks.
- **K-Means Clustering**: [Understand](https://machine-learning-kmeans.streamlit.app/) how K-Means clustering works to partition data into k clusters.
- **Linear Regression**: [Visualize](https://machine-learning-visualizers-linear-regression.streamlit.app/) the relationship between variables and how Linear Regression can be used to predict outcomes.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: [Learn](https://machine-learning-visualizers-random-forest.streamlit.app/) about the ensemble approach using multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: [Discover](https://machine-learning-visualizers-svm.streamlit.app/) how SVM can be used for both linear and non-linear classification.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: [See](https://machine-learning-visualizers-pca.streamlit.app/) how PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible.
- **Neural Networks**: [Dive](https://machine-learning-visualizers-neural.streamlit.app/) into the workings of Neural Networks and see how they can model complex patterns in data.

## Features

- Interactive parameter tuning to visualize how each algorithm responds to changes.
- Real-time updates to decision boundaries or outputs based on user input.
- Visualization of key metrics and performance data.

### Prerequisites

To run these applications, you'll need Python installed on your system. The applications also require several Python libraries, listed in `requirements.txt`.
